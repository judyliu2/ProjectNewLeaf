2048


/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow we so BOSS bc...

1. We figured out how to separate significant and insignificant values in 2D arrays! By using a specific instance as a nullValue, we can keep track of where it isn't significant.

2. We figured out justification, and it works very nicely!

3. We added features that would ensure that the user is limited accordingly in their options, i.e. safe for bad users! From now on, you can't swipe in a direction that wouldn't change the current grid.

4. We found a way to continue the game if the board is filled but there are still tiles that can merge.

5. We adapted the code to take on different grid sizes for changes in difficulty.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
blah blah pesky bug...
maybe some of these will move into the Obs.Ovrcm section...

1. Packages are limited. No clue how to hold just 2048 in the root of the repo...especially with an interface, yeesh.


COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow! oo!...

1. Learned what a package is, and explored importation. Though, this is hard to apply...

2. Learned how to justify up and down in a 2D array

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
we changed ___ to ___ bc...

1. 2017-01-12
   We made a new class called Grid2 to contain integers instead of Tiles (temporarily) because Tile class wasn't created yet. 

2. 2017-01-18
   We decided to let the user change the Grid size instead of using a standard 4x4 Grid all the time because it would have improved UX and allow the user to choose their own difficulty levels.

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
tales of wisdom gained...

1. Merge conflicts happen a lot. Thus, coordination is key.

Samantha :: Helped with editing UML diagram, copied files from library to git repo; added to devlog.

2017-01-12
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Carol :: created Grid.java, worked on set(), get(), leftJustify(). Used leftJustify and copy and paste to do upJustify() and downJustify(). Made diligent comments
Judy :: worked on Grid.java,  worked on rightJustify(), added Grid2.java which takes integers, fixed flowchart.
Samantha :: worked on Grid.java, worked on Grid(), created main().

2017-01-13
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Judy :: Created Tiles and Empty classes and their methods.

2017-01-15
--------------------------------------------------------------
Carol :: created a skeleton for 2048, added Keyboard.java, augmented Grid, added 2048 functionality and swiping
Judy :: wrote turn() 2048, changed "2048.java" to "Game2048.java", helped with swipe() methods 
Samantha :: wrote interface Equalizer, constructor, and game(); fixed minor syntax; augmented turn()

--------------------------------------------------------------
All: Worked together to solve swipe() bug.


2017-01-19
--------------------------------------------------------------
Judy :: Made method checker() to check if neighbors of a tile is mergeable to itself, used this method to determine if the player loses after the grid is filled and updated UML diagram.
